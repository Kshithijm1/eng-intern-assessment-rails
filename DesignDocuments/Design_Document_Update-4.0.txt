OVERVIEW

This document outlines the implementation of new files and features added
since the last update. This recent update focuses on the enhanced view model
for a responsive webpage in the article section, improving user experience
and interaction.

COMPONENTS

1. Aesthetic Redesign
    - The objective was to enhance the visual appeal of the webpage for the
      betterment of the user experience.
    - The redesign is done using the application.css file.
    - The layout is more aesthetically pleasing than before and it is easier to
      interact with.
    - The color scheme is also more visually pleasing

2. Search Functionality Enhancement
    - The objective was to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the search function.

3. _form.html.erb (new page, edit page)
    - This page controls the interactive parts of the new page and the edit page. In this
      update, this page allows for the user to upload an image that will directly connect
      to the article.
    - Additional javascript code is added into this page so that if the user wants to break
      the line in their text by hitting enter, the article will not submit itself. By hitting
      enter without the shift key, the cursor will go to the next line. With the shift key, the
      article will submit.

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. Look for any bugs and and make sure the tests work before submission.
